# Scrolling Animation | V3

Welcome to the second version of the **Scrolling Animation** project — where raw function from V2 meets modern flair in V3. This version builds on the foundational scroll-triggered animation demo, polishing the visuals, enhancing responsiveness, and refining how each element enters the stage.

Still HTML + CSS. Still lightweight. But now it’s got style.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Dynamically renders a collection of blocks (`div.block`) that animate into view as you scroll down.
- Uses the experimental CSS `animation-timeline: view()` property to tie animations directly to scroll behavior — no JavaScript needed.
- Clean flexbox layout to arrange the blocks in rows and wrap them responsively.

## 🔧 Improvements from V2

Revamped visual style with fresh, modern color. now featuring smooth linear gradients for a more dynamic and appealing look.


### 🎨 Design & Aesthetics

- **Modern Color Palette:** Replaced flat *coral* with a more vibrant, gradient-based color scheme for a richer look.
- **Visual Polish:** Blocks now have softer edges, subtle shadows, and smarter spacing that makes the layout feel less crowded and more intentional.
- **Minimalist UI Refinement:** While still simple, V2 ditches the “prototype” look and edges closer to something you'd actually want to show off.

### 💨 Animation Enhancements

- **Smoother Transitions:** The clip-path reveal feels more fluid and natural.
- **Fine-tuned Scroll Triggers:** The animation timing better matches scroll behavior, creating a more immersive feel.

### 📱 Responsive Layout

- Flex-wrap behaves more gracefully at different screen widths.
- Layout scales better on smaller devices — still not fully mobile-first, but much improved from V1’s rigid grid.

### 🧼 Cleaner Code

- Improved structure in both HTML and CSS.
- Less duplication, more clarity. Easier to expand or remix for future features.
